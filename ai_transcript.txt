Tool: ChatGPT 
Context: I'm new to Java and used AI to help me start and structure assignment 2 correctly.

Summary: How I used AI
I used ChatGPT to confirm I was working in the correct Git Repo and show how to clone/pull properly. I also used Chat to set up the required package structure and the project folder, and provided a starter ETL implementation and helped debug early issues.

Prompts I asked:
Is my code in the original repo
How could I approach this assignment to start the code
Can you provide code snippets of different examples to tackle the assignment?

 AI response (excerpt):
"Create src/org/howard/edu/lsp/assignment2/ETLPipeline.java with
'package org.howard.edu.lsp.assignment2;'. Compile/run from the project root:
 javac -d bin src/org/howard/edu/lsp/assignment2/ETLPipeline.java
 java -cp bin org.howard.edu.lsp.assignment2.ETLPipeline
Place CSVs in data/ to use relative paths."

How I used/modified it:
 Used the structure, compile/run steps, and ETL flow (uppercase → discount → recategorize → price range).
 Modified the header/empty-case logic to return List<String[]> consistently.
 Kept BigDecimal HALF_UP rounding and added minor comments to fit my style.
