Assignment 2 focused on implementing a basic ETL pipeline in a largely procedural way, emphasizing correct data extraction, transformation, and loading but with most of the logic contained in a single flow. Assignment 3 built on that foundation by requiring an object-oriented design, where the ETL process was broken into distinct classes and packages to improve modularity, encapsulation, and maintainability. This shift from a linear script to a class-based architecture introduced new challenges—such as deciding on appropriate abstractions, managing class interactions, and ensuring low coupling—but also demonstrated how thoughtful design makes testing, extending, and reusing code much easier. Overall, the experience highlighted the difference between simply writing code that works and engineering a flexible, well-structured system.
