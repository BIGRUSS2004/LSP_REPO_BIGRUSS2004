Device is abstract to share core logic while preventing direct instantiation. 
Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces add optional behaviors that concrete classes can implement independently. 
This is not multiple inheritance of implementation; Java allows only one superclass, so we achieve multiple inheritance of type through interfaces. 
The design promotes flexibility and code reuse without the issues of deep inheritance trees.
